# Google Dinosaur Game Bot

## Background
The Google "Dinosaur Game" is a built-in Chrome browser game. The user controls a Dinosaur and dodges obstacles (specifically birds and cacti) that appear along its path. While intended only for the Chrome browser, the game has since been made available on various websites. 

## Purpose
This bot automates playing the game on one such website.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that pyautogui is installed
2. Run the script. Your browser will launch and navigate to the Dinosaur Game website
3. In the browser press the spacebar to initially start the game. The script will control the Dinosaur's actions
4. Press "Esc" at any time to exit the game and stop the script

_Note: You may need to adjust the coordinates and x- and y- ranges, in the config file, to better suit your screen resolution._
